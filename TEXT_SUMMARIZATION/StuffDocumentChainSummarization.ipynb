    "# Stuff Documentation\n",
    "Stuffing means loading all relevant documents or text chunks into the prompt and passing them to the LLM at once, often for summarization or answering a question.\n",

    "## How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Retrieve top-k relevant documents (using a vector store or search).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Concatenate them.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simple and direct.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Useful for small document sets that fit within the context window.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Limited by the token limit of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Performance degrades with too much or irrelevant content (\"prompt stuffing\")."
