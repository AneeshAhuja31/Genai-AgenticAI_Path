Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number.

This\\nhurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\\n6 Results\\n6.1 Machine Translation\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)\\nin Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0\\nBLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2 Model Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8'),\n",

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

He is called the king, the chase master and the run machine for his playing style, records and ability to lead the team to victory.[6] Kohli is the highest run-scorer in the Indian Premier League, third in T20I, third in ODI, and third in international cricket.[7] Regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time, he holds the record for the most ODI centuries and has the second most centuries in international cricket.[8] Kohli is also the only captain to lead India to three consecutive Test mace wins during 2017, 2018, and 2019.[9]\\nKohli led the Indian team to victory at the 2008 U19 World Cup and was a key member of the teams that won the 2011 ODI World Cup, 2013 Champions Trophy, 2024 T20 World Cup and 2025 Champions Trophy. He represents Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the Indian Premier League and Delhi in domestic cricket. In 2013, Kohli was ranked number one in the ODI batting rankings. In 2015, he achieved the same in T20I.[10] In 2018, he was ranked the number one Test batsman, making him the only Indian to hold the number one spot in all three formats. He is the first player to score 20,000 runs in a decade. ICC named him the male cricketer of the decade for the years 2011 to 2020.[11]\\nKohli has garnered 10 ICC Awards making him the most awarded player in international cricket history. He won the ODI Player of the Year award four times in 2012, 2017, 2018, and 2023. He has also won the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy given to the Cricketer of the Year, on two occasions, in 2017 and 2018. In 2018, he touched his peak and became the first player to win all the three major awards Garfield Sobers trophy, ODI and Test Player of the Year awards in the same year. He was awarded with Spirit of Cricket Award in 2019. He was also awarded with Cricketer of the Decade and ODI Cricketer of the Decade in 2020. Kohli was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World for three consecutive years, from 2016 to 2018. Kohli has the most Player of the Series awards and second most Player of the Match awards to his name in all three formats combined. He was honoured with the Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri in 2017, and India\\'s highest sporting honour, the Khel Ratna Award, in 2018. Time magazine included him on its list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2018.\\nAfter winning the 2024 T20 World Cup and winning the Player of the Match award in the final, Kohli announced his retirement from T20Is.[12] He is married to actress Anushka Sharma and they have two children.[13]\\n\\n\\nEarly life\\nKohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His mother Saroj Kohli is as a housewife while his father Prem Nath Kohli worked as a criminal lawyer. He has an elder brother Vikas and an elder sister Bhawna.[14] His formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. His early education was at Vishal Bharti Public School.[15] As per his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a 3-year-old. He would pick up a bat and request his father bowl to him.[16]\\nIn 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy was created. In May, his father arranged for him to meet Rajkumar Sharma.[1] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli\\'s father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed his ability merited more than gully cricket.[17] He was unable to secure a place in the U-14 Delhi team, due to extraneous factors. His father reportedly received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would ensure his selection, but he declined the proposals. \\nKohli found his way into the U-15 team.[1] He received training at the academy and participated in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave.[18] In pursuit of furthering his cricketing career, he transferred to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education.[17]\\nOn 18 December 2006, his father died due to a cerebral attack.[17][15] As per his mother, Kohli\\'s demeanour shifted noticeably after his father\\'s death. He took on cricket with newfound seriousness, prioritizing playing time and dedicating himself fully to the sport.[17] Kohli\\'s family resided in Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar until the year 2015, after which they relocated to Gurgaon.[19]\\n\\nYouth career\\n\\n\\nRepresenting  India\\n\\n\\nU19 World Cup\\n\\n\\n 2008 Malaysia\\n\\nCaptain\\n\\nPlayer of the MatchVs West IndiesVs New Zealand\\n\\nDelhi team\\nKohli\\'s junior cricket career kicked off in October 2002 at the Luhnu Cricket Ground against Himachal Pradesh. His first half-century in domestic cricket happened at Feroze Shah Kotla, where he scored 70 runs against Haryana.[1] By the end of the season, he had amassed a total of 172 runs, emerging as the highest run-scorer for his side with an average of 34.40.[20] During the 2003–04 season, Kohli was appointed the captain of the U-15 team. He scored 54 runs in Delhi\\'s victory over Himachal Pradesh. In the next fixture against Jammu and Kashmir, Kohli scored his maiden century with a score of 119. By the end of the season, he had a total of 390 runs at an average of 78, which included two centuries.[21][1] Towards the end of 2004, Kohli earned selection for the 2004–05 Vijay Merchant Trophy with the Delhi U-17 team. In the four matches that he played, Kohli had a total of 470 runs, with his highest score being 251* runs.\\nThe team\\'s coach, Ajit Chaudhary, lauded his performance and was particularly impressed with his temperament on the field.[1][22] He commenced the 2005–06 season with a score of 227 against Punjab. Following their victory over Uttar Pradesh in the quarter-finals, Delhi was scheduled to play against Baroda in the semi-finals. The team had high expectations from Kohli, who had promised his coach to finish the job. True to his word, Kohli went on to score 228 runs, leading Delhi to victory. The team later secured the tournament with a five-wicket win over Mumbai, where he contributed with a half-century in the first innings.[1] He ended as the highest run-scorer with a total of 757 runs from 7 matches, averaging 84.11.[23]\\nOn 18 February 2006, Kohli made his debut in List A cricket, playing against Services in the Ranji One-Day Trophy, but he did not get the opportunity to bat during the match.[24] In 2006, Kohli got a spot in the state senior team. Subsequently, he made his first-class debut on 23 November 2006, during the opening match of the Ranji Trophy season against Tamil Nadu. However, his debut innings was a brief one, as he was dismissed after scoring ten runs.[1] In the subsequent match against former champions, Karnataka, Delhi found themselves trailing with a score of 130/5, with Kohli remaining unbeaten on 40 at the end of the day\\'s play. That night, Kohli\\'s father passed away. Despite the heart-wrenching news, Kohli returned to the match and continued to bat and scored 90 runs before he was dismissed.[25] Chetan Chauhan, the coach, was impressed by his determination and unwavering attitude in the face of adversity. Venkatesh Prasad lauded his crucial knock, which was executed in the midst of an emotional upheaval.[26] After his dismissal, Kohli attended his father\\'s funeral. His innings proved to be crucial for Delhi as they were able to avoid the follow-on. The team\\'s captain, Mithun Manhas, praised Kohli for his performance, acknowledging its pivotal role in the team\\'s success.[26]\\nKohli\\'s foray into T20 cricket first happened in April 2007, during the Inter-State T20 Championship, where he emerged as the top run-getter for his team with a tally of 179 runs at an average of 35.80.[27] In Sep 2008, Kohli played in Nissar Trophy against SNGPL. He emerged as the leading scorer for Delhi in both innings, registering 52 runs in the first innings and a towering 197 in the second. The match ultimately ended in a draw, SNGPL being declared the victors due to their lead in first innings.[28] In the 2009–10 Ranji Trophy season, Kohli returned to domestic cricket. During a match against Maharashtra, he opened the batting and scored 67 runs, helping Delhi to secure the bonus point required for victory.[29] Kohli\\'s performance reinvigorated the competitive spirit of the domestic cricket circuit.\\n\\nI did not see him waste his time. If not on the field, he would be busy in the gym. I saw him first as a chubby-cheeked bubbly young kid who grew into a perfect athlete. His junior cricket lessons have obviously helped him. I did not know him well, but had heard a lot about his exploits in junior cricket.—\\u200aAshish Nehra, [1]\\nIndia U19 team\\nIn July 2006, Kohli was selected in the India Under-19 squad on its tour of England. He averaged 105 in the three-match ODI series against England Under-19s,[30] while also averaging 49 in the 3-match Test series.[31] Following India U-19 success in both the ODI and Test series, the team\\'s coach Lalchand Rajput noted Kohli\\'s adeptness in facing both pace and spin bowling and expressed his admiration for his technical prowess.[32] In September, the U-19 team toured Pakistan. In the first Test match, Kohli scored 63 and 28 as India won by 271 runs against Pakistan Under-19s. In the 2nd match, he contributed 83 runs to India\\'s victory by 240 runs and an innings. He concluded the tour with 80 runs in the final ODI game at Lahore.[1]  In early 2007, Kohli was a part of the India U-19 team that toured New Zealand, where he scored 113 in the first Test match. The series ended in a draw. In the following month, the team travelled to Malaysia for a tri-series against England Under-19s and Sri Lanka Under-19s, where Kohli did not get many opportunities to bat. In July–August, India U-19 embarked on a tour for a tri-series against Sri Lanka Under-19s and Bangladesh Under-19s, where he did not score a half-century in any of the matches. He made a comeback with scores of 144 and an unbeaten 94 in the following Test series.[1]\\nKohli came into the limelight in 2008 when he led the team to victory in the  U-19 World Cup. He led the Indian squad and won the 2008 U-19 World Cup held in Malaysia.[33]  He amassed 235 runs at an average of 47, ranking as the tournament\\'s third-highest scorer and one of three cricketers to compile a century.[34] His century, a knock of 100 runs off 74 balls, versus the West Indies Under-19s in a group stage encounter, was lauded by ESPNcricinfo, as \"the innings of the tournament.\" This innings paved the way for India\\'s 50-run triumph and fetched Kohli the man of the match award.[35] Additionally, Kohli\\'s all-round performance in the semi-final against New Zealand Under-19s, where he captured 2 wickets and contributed 43 runs in the run-chase, was core to India\\'s victory.[36] In the championship match, Kohli managed a score of 19 against South Africa Under-19s and his contribution lead to the eventual 12-run win (via D/L method).[37]\\nIn June 2008, Kohli and his U-19 teammates Pradeep Sangwan and Tanmay Srivastava were awarded the Border–Gavaskar scholarship. This scholarship, aimed at honing the skills of the chosen cricketers, provided an opportunity to train for six weeks at Cricket Australia\\'s Centre of Excellence in Brisbane.[38] In a bid to identify potential talent for the senior team, Kohli was selected to represent India Emerging Players in the Emerging Players Tournament 2008. His finest performance in the tournament was against New Zealand Emerging Players, where he played a knock of 120 runs, leading India to a seven-wicket victory. With an aggregate of 204 runs, Kohli\\'s performances did not go unnoticed by the selectors who were observing his progress. He began his international cricket journey by joining the senior team in Colombo, having played 28 Under-19 ODIs and 12 Under-19 Tests.[1]\\n\\nInternational career\\nMain article: Career of Virat Kohli\\n\\n\\nRepresenting  India\\n\\n\\nODI World Cup\\n\\n\\n 2011 India & Bangladesh & Sri Lanka\\n\\n\\n 2023 India\\n\\nPlayer of the MatchVs BangladeshVs South Africa\\n\\nPlayer of the Tournament\\n\\n\\n 2015 Australia & New Zealand\\n\\nPlayer of the MatchVs Pakistan\\n\\n\\n 2019 England & Wales\\n\\nPlayer of the MatchVs West Indies\\n\\n\\nT20 World Cup\\n\\n\\n 2024 West Indies & United States\\n\\nPlayer of the MatchVs South Africa\\n\\n\\n 2014 Bangladesh\\n\\nPlayer of the MatchVs South Africa\\n\\nPlayer of the Tournament\\n\\n\\n 2016 India\\n\\nPlayer of the MatchVs PakistanVs Australia\\n\\nPlayer of the Tournament\\n\\n\\n 2022 Australia\\n\\nPlayer of the MatchVs PakistanVs Bangladesh\\n\\n\\nWorld Test Championship\\n\\n\\n 2021 England\\n\\nPlayer of the MatchVs South Africa\\n\\n\\n 2023 England\\n\\nPlayer of the MatchVs Australia\\n\\n\\n 2025 England\\n\\n\\nChampions Trophy\\n\\n\\n 2013 England & Wales\\n\\n\\n 2025 United Arab Emirates\\n\\nPlayer of the MatchVs PakistanVs Australia\\n\\n\\n 2017 England & Wales\\n\\n\\nAsia Cup\\n\\n\\n 2010 Sri Lanka\\n\\n\\n 2016 Bangladesh\\n\\nPlayer of the MatchVs PakistanVs Sri Lanka\\n\\n\\n 2023 Sri Lanka\\n\\nPlayer of the MatchVs Pakistan\\n\\nDebut and maiden stint (2008–2009)\\nIn 2008, Kohli was included in the ODl squad for the Sri Lanka tour and the Champions Trophy.[39] He was required to fill the role of makeshift opener throughout the Sri Lankan series.[40] On August 18, 2008, Kohli made his international debut at the age of 19 in the first ODI of the tour.[41] In the 4th match of the series, Kohli scored his first half century in ODl consisting of fifty-four runs.[42]\\nHe was picked in the India A squad for the Tests against Australia A in September.[43] Despite limited opportunities, he managed to make an impact in the single innings that he participated in, scoring 49 runs.[44] In Oct, Kohli participate in a four-day tour match against Australia as part of the Indian Board President\\'s XI team. The match featured a formidable Australian bowling line-up that consisted of Brett Lee, Stuart Clark, Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle and Jason Krejza. Despite this, Kohli scored 105 runs in the first innings, showing his ability to perform against top international competition.[45]\\nIn December, Kohli was awarded a Grade D contract by the Board of Control for Cricket in India as part of the annual contract list for the Indian national team which entitled him to receive ₹1.5 million (equivalent to ₹4.2\\xa0million or US$49,000 in 2023).[46]\\nIn 2009, Kohli was selected in the four-team Emerging Players Tournament in Australia. He went on to have a standout performance and finished as the tournament\\'s leading run-scorer, with a total of 398 runs from seven matches, at an average of 66.33. In the final match, he scored 104 runs off 102 balls against the South Africa Emerging Players in Brisbane. His strong performance helped lead his team to a 17-run victory and the tournament title.[47][48] Kris Srikkanth, the chairman of the Indian national selection committee, expressed his admiration for his performance during the tournament.[49] Kohli later stated that this tournament was a \"turning point\" in his career.[50]\\nIn August, Kohli was a part of the Indian squad for the tri-series in Sri Lanka.[51] He was utilized as a middle order batsman in the 2009 Champions Trophy.[52] In December, he was included in the team for the ODI series against Sri Lanka  and scored 27 and 54 in the first two ODIs.[53] Kohli scored his maiden ODI century, 107 off 114 balls while sharing a 224 run partnership with Gautam Gambhir. As a result, India won by seven wickets and sealed the series 3–1.[54][c]\\n\\nRise through the ranks (2010–2011)\\nIn January 2010, Kohli played the tri-nation ODI tournament in Bangladesh.[55] During the series, he became just the third Indian player to score two ODI centuries before the age of 22.[56] He was widely hailed for his performances, and ultimately emerged as the leading run-scorer of the series, with 275 runs from 5 innings at an impressive average of 91.66.[57] His initial foray into leadership on an international level occurred in May to June 2010, when he was appointed as vice-captain for the tri-series against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Despite an early setback, Kohli managed to become the fastest Indian batsman at the time to reach 1,000 runs in ODI cricket, achieving this milestone in 24 innings.[58] He also made his International T20 debut against Zimbabwe at Harare, where he scored an unbeaten 26.[59] During the 2010 Asia Cup, he was included in the team and was given batting at number 3.\\n\\nKohli with Duncan Fletcher\\nHe faced some struggles with form but was retained in the ODI squad for a three-match series against Australia in October. Kohli scored a century, earning him the man of the match award.[60] During the home ODI series against New Zealand, Kohli scored another match-winning century, marking his fourth ODI hundred and second in succession.[61] The Indian team emerged victorious with a 5–0 whitewash over New Zealand and his performances solidified his position in the ODI team, making him a strong candidate for a spot in India\\'s World Cup squad.[62][63] He was India\\'s leading run-scorer in ODIs in 2010, accumulating 995 runs from 25 matches at an average of 47.38, including three centuries and seven half-centuries.[64]\\n\\nHe is a very physical type of player. He likes to impose himself on the game, backs it up with his skill.—\\u200aDav Whatmore, [65]\\nKohli was India\\'s leading run scorer in the five-match ODI series at the South African tour in January 2011, with 193 runs including two fifties.[66] During the series, he jumped to number two spot on the ICC Rankings for men\\'s ODI batters,[67] and was named in India\\'s 15-man squad for the World Cup.[68]\\nKohli scored an unbeaten 100 in the first match against Bangladesh and became the first Indian batsman to score a century on his World Cup debut.[69] In the final against Sri Lanka at Mumbai, he scored 35, sharing an 83 runs partnership with Gambhir for the third wicket after India had lost both openers within seven overs while chasing 275.[70][71]\\nWhen India toured the West Indies in June and July 2011, Kohli was one of the three uncapped players in the Test squad.[72]  He made his Test debut at Kingston in the first match.[73] India went on to win the series 1–0 but Kohli amassed just 76 runs from five innings, struggling against the short ball.[74]\\nKohli later scored his sixth ODI hundred, 107 runs off 93 balls with a 170 run partnership with Rahul Dravid who was playing his last ODI match.[75] It was the only century in the series by any player of either team.[76]\\nIn October 2011, Kohli was the leading run scorer of the five-match home ODI series against England which India won 5–0.

Among the franchises, Royal Challengers Bangalore, owned by Vijay Mallya at the time, selected Kohli to join their team for a sum of $50,000 through a draft. This decision was influenced by his performance in the U19 World Cup in Malaysia which India won under him.[141]\\n\\nEarly seasons (2008–2009)\\nIn the inaugural IPL match, Kohli played in a high-stakes encounter against the Kolkata Knight Riders where he lost his wicket early during the team\\'s pursuit of a target of 223 runs.[142] As the event progressed, he found himself occupying a position in the middle order, but he was reinstated at the top order during the match against Deccan Charges. It was in this role that he rediscovered his form and made contributions to the cause.[143]\\nHowever, in the last two games, he had to sacrifice his preferred position in order to accommodate Misbah-ul-Haq, taking on the responsibility of batting in the middle order once again.[144] Concluding the season, Kohli\\'s individual performance yielded a total of 165 runs, as Bangalore secured the seventh position on the points table.[145]\\n\\nKohli batting against Pune Warriors India.\\nIn the subsequent season, Kohli encountered a series of low scores in the initial 2 matches before bouncing back with a half-century in the third match against Deccan Chargers, in team\\'s defeat.[146] Throughout the remainder of the season, Kohli displayed moderate performances or found limited opportunities to bat, owing to the dominance of top-order batsmen Jacques Kallis and Ross Taylor. This proved advantageous for the team, as they secured a spot in the playoffs.[147] In the semi-final against Chennai Super Kings, Kohli made contributions to the chase, leading Bangalore to the final.[148] In final against Deccan Charges, Bangalore fell short by a margin of 8 runs, thus concluding the season as runners-up.[149]\\n\\nRise, retention and realization (2010–2012)\\nIn the 2010 season of the IPL, Kohli was the vice-captain for RCB and was positioned in the middle order. He augmented Bangalore\\'s batting depth and made contributions to the team\\'s success. Notably, his contribution was observed during a victory over the Kings XI Punjab, where he played an instrumental role in concluding the match.[150] His cameos in away fixtures against the Chennai Super Kings[151] and Kings XI Punjab, forging valuable partnerships, particularly with Kevin Pietersen, were crucial.[152] Kohli\\'s standout performance came in an encounter against the Deccan Chargers, where he scored 58 runs at a strike rate of 165.[153] As the season progressed, Kohli\\'s fielding prowess also came to the fore, furthering his contribution to the team\\'s cause.[154] Upon securing a place in the playoffs, the Bangalore team confronted Mumbai Indians in the semi-final. Bangalore suffered a setback, succumbing to a defeat margin of 35 runs, thus ending Bangalore\\'s campaign in the tournament.[155] In the Champions League Twenty20 held in September, Bangalore found themselves in an encounter against the Mumbai Indians. In pursuit of a target of 165 runs, Kohli played a steady innings, contributing 47 runs. The match came to the final ball, which resulted in Kohli\\'s dismissal, leading to Bangalore falling short by a margin of 2 runs.[156] As a consequence, their upcoming game against the Lions became a virtual knockout match. In this must-win encounter, Kohli scored 49* runs, guiding his team to victory, securing a place in the semi-finals.[157] In the semi-final clash against the Chennai Super Kings, RCB faced a significant defeat of 52 runs.\\nPrior to the 2011 season of the IPL, Kohli was the sole player retained by Bangalore, for an amount of US$1.8 million.[158] In the opening match against the Kochi Tuskers Kerala, Kohli started his campaign with a score of 23 runs.[159] He registered his first half-century of the season against the Deccan Chargers, in pursuit of what was then the second-highest run chase, however Bangalore fell short by 33 runs.[160] After lacklustre start for Bangalore, winning two out of their first six matches, Kohli scored 56 runs in the next match against the Delhi Daredevils, and was awarded the player of the match for the first time in the tournament.[161] In the subsequent match, he continued his form against the Pune Warriors, where he claimed his second player of the match award. It was during this match that Kohli became the leading run-scorer of the season, donning the Orange cap, and he also surpassed the milestone of 1000 runs in the IPL.[162] With regular captain Daniel Vettori sustaining an injury, Kohli had the opportunity to captain his side for the first time in an IPL match.[163] Team\\'s coach, Ray Jennings praised Kohli for his efforts, acknowledged his potential to become the future captain not only of the franchise but also of the Indian national team.[164] The team ended their league stage campaign on a high note, defeating the Chennai Super Kings and securing the top position on the table.[165]\\nIn the first qualifier, Kohli scored 70 off 44 balls. Setting a target of 175 runs, RCB failed to defend, resulting in a knockout against the Mumbai Indians.[166] In the knockout match, Bangalore triumphed over Mumbai, securing their place in the IPL final for the second time. In the final, chasing a target of 205 runs, Kohli contributed 35 runs to the team\\'s total. However, Bangalore once again fell short in their pursuit of the title.[167] During the season, Kohli amassed 557 runs with 4 half-centuries, and earning the distinction of being the second-highest run-scorer of the season, trailing West-Indian teammate Chris Gayle.[168] In the Champions League, RCB encountered a defeat in their first match against the Warriors. In the following match, Kohli got dismissed for a duck, leading to another loss for Bangalore. To secure a spot in the semi-finals, they needed to win their remaining two matches. In their last group-stage match against the Southern Redbacks, Kohli showcased his aggressive batting by scoring 70 runs off just 36 balls, propelling Bangalore into the semi-finals.[169] In the semi-final clash against the New South Wales Blues, Kohli once again played match-winning innings, scoring an unbeaten 84 runs.[170] However, in the final showdown against the Mumbai Indians, Bangalore suffered a defeat by a margin of 31 runs.\\n\\nKohli playing against CSK during 2014 IPL\\nIn the 2012 season, Kohli had single-digit scores in the first 2 matches but bounced back in the 3rd match against the Chennai Super Kings, scoring 57 runs.[171] He reached a total of 165 runs by the 9tg game.[172] He managed to contribute 45 runs in the next match against the Kings XI Punjab to his team\\'s cause.[173] As the season progressed, ineffectiveness of Bangalore\\'s captain, Daniel Vettori, as a player led to a strategic alteration. Vettori made the decision to step down as captain and handed the leadership role to Kohli for the remaining matches of the season.[174] His breakthrough performance in the season came during the match against the Delhi Daredevils where he scored 73* and formed a record-breaking partnership of 203 runs with his teammate Gayle.[175] In their final match of the season, Bangalore faced the Deccan Chargers with the necessity of must-win to qualify for the playoffs. Kohli contributed 42 runs to the team\\'s chase before being dismissed in the 16th over. His dismissal triggered a collapse in Bangalore\\'s batting order, resulting in their eventual defeat and elimination from the tournament during the group stage.[176] During the season, Kohli accumulated a total of 364 runs, garnered over the course of 16 matches. He returned from the League with a sense of disillusionment with his own performance and was dissatisfied with the state of his game. He recognized the need for improvement and adaptation to the evolving dynamics of cricket.[177]\\n\\nLeadership role (2013–2014)\\nFollowing Vettori\\'s retirement, Kohli assumed the role of full-time captain for the Bangalore team starting from the 2013 season of the IPL. Prior to the commencement of this season, he was highest run-scorer for Bangalore with a tally of 1,639 runs.[178] Kohli embarked on the tournament with a consistent start, but suffered a loss against the Sunrisers Hyderabad in an away game.[179] In their subsequent home match, once again against Hyderabad, Kohli scored unbeaten 93 while chasing, marking his highest individual score in Twenty20 cricket at that time.[180] Continuing his form, Kohli went on to score back-to-back fifties in the matches against the Chennai Super Kings and the Delhi Daredevils, the latter of which was decided through a super over.[181] After a defeat against the Mumbai Indians, Kohli found himself embroiled in a disagreement with the crowd due to their aggressive demeanour towards the visiting team at the Wankhede Stadium.[182] As the mid-season approached, Kohli encountered a dip in his performance, managing 45 runs in four innings.[183] He bounced back during the away game against Delhi, where he came close to achieving a century, scoring 99 before being run out on the final delivery.[184] With a strong start to the season that saw Bangalore occupying the top position in the table, the team\\'s performance waned in the latter half of the tournament.[185] Kohli openly addressed the issue, attributing their decline to a lack of execution by the bowling unit.[186] In a bid to keep their playoff hopes alive, Bangalore confronted a must-win scenario in their final match against Chennai. Opening the innings, Kohli scored an unbeaten 56 in a rain-affected match, ultimately leading his team to victory.[187] However, Bangalore\\'s hopes were shattered when the Hyderabad secured a win over the Kolkata Knight Riders, dashing their chances of advancing to the playoffs. As a result, Bangalore\\'s season came to an end during the group stage.[188]\\nPrior to the seventh season of the IPL, Kohli was retained by Bangalore for ₹12.5 crore (US$1.5\\xa0million).[189] His campaign commenced with an unbeaten score of 49 runs in a victorious encounter against the Delhi Daredevils.[190] However, Kohli struggled to maintain his form and faced a dismissal without scoring in the second match. In a match against the Rajasthan Royals, Bangalore\\'s batting lineup faltered, resulting in them being bowled out for 70, then third-lowest total in IPL history. Kohli contributed 21 runs to the team\\'s total in that particular match.[191] Bangalore heavily relied on the performances of Gayle and Kohli in their batting lineup, but neither of them had managed a significant innings thus far in the season.[192] Kohli\\'s struggles persisted as he recorded his third duck of the season in a match against the Kings XI Punjab.[193] In an effort to address the batting woes, Kohli made the decision to alter his batting position and open the innings; however, this adjustment did not yield the desired outcome.[194] With Bangalore losing six out of their nine games, Kohli had yet to reach the milestone of scoring a half-century. Meanwhile, the team was striving to secure victories in their remaining matches in order to qualify for the playoffs.[192] In his twelfth game of the season against the Sunrisers Hyderabad, Kohli achieved his first fifty of the season. However, the subsequent defeat to the Kolkata Knight Riders, with Kohli contributing 38 runs before being dismissed by Sunil Narine for the second time, led to Bangalore\\'s elimination from playoff contention for the third consecutive time.[195] In their final match of the season against the Chennai Super Kings, Kohli showcased his best performance of the season, accumulating 73 runs. However, Bangalore suffered a defeat in that match.[196] Despite the team\\'s challenges, Kohli\\'s popularity continued to soar, making him the most-searched player on the internet during the tournament.[197]\\n\\nCollective and individual success (2015–2016)\\nKohli as the captain of the Royal Challengers Bangalore at the 2015 IPL Opening Ceremony\\nAt the outset of the 2015 season of the IPL, Kohli expressed his optimism about playing with reduced pressure, attributing it to the strengthened middle order of the Bangalore team.[198] Kohli strategically decided to open the batting alongside Gayle for the season. In the second match against the Sunrisers Hyderabad, he scored 41 runs, providing a moderate start to his campaign.[199] Continuing his form, Kohli achieved his first half-century of the season, albeit in a match that ended in defeat against the Chennai Super Kings.[200] In the subsequent match, Kohli again notched a fifty, leading Bangalore to victory and ending their three-match losing streak.[201] During this match, he promoted AB de Villiers up the batting order, recognizing the importance of having the team\\'s premier batsman face more deliveries.[202] Bangalore, looking to overcome their previous struggles in the bowling department, successfully bowled out the Delhi Daredevils for 95 runs, while Kohli guided his team to a ten-wicket victory during the chase.[203] However, in an away game against Chennai, Kohli fell short of reaching a half-century, scoring 48 runs before being run out by Dwayne Bravo due to a momentary lapse in judgment. Bangalore\\'s loss in that match marked the end of their winning streak.[204] His standout innings of the season came against the Mumbai Indians, where he played a knock of 82 runs, forming a then record partnership of 215 runs with de Villiers.[205] In a rain-affected match against the Hyderabad, with a target of 83 runs to chase in six overs, Kohli scored quickfire 44 off 19 balls, earning him player of the match award.[206] In the subsequent game, Kohli found himself entangled in an incident involving an anti-corruption code breach. Nonetheless, he managed to continue playing due to breach\\'s absence of severity.[207] Qualifying for the playoffs for the first time under his captaincy, Kohli held firm confidence in the turnaround his team had showcased during the later stages of the league.[208] However, in the qualifier 2 against Chennai, Kohli\\'s dismissal for 12 runs proved detrimental to Bangalore\\'s chances, resulting in their defeat and the conclusion of their campaign for the season. Throughout the season, Kohli accumulated a total of 505 runs in 16 matches with an average of 45.90, then third-highest run tally achieved by him in a single season.[209]\\nIn the 2016 season of the IPL, Kohli\\'s campaign began with 75 runs, contributing to a victory of 45 runs against the Sunrisers Hyderabad.[210] He continued his run in the subsequent match, scoring 79 runs. Throughout the early matches, Kohli consistently achieved the milestone of scoring half-centuries in three out of the four matches he played, while sharing three century partnerships with de Villiers.[211] In the encounter against the Gujarat Lions, he registered his first century in Twenty20 cricket. Although the match ended in defeat for his team, Kohli\\'s knock earned him the player of the match.[212] Despite Kohli\\'s performances, Bangalore struggled in the league stage, securing only two victories out of their seven matches and finding themselves in the seventh position on the points table.[213] To revive their chances of qualifying for the playoffs, Bangalore needed to win six out of their next seven matches. In the subsequent match, Kohli scored a century in a successful chase against Rising Pune Supergiant as Bangalore\\'s virtual knockouts began.[214] He continued to deliver match-winning performances, forming a record partnership of 229 runs with de Villiers against the Gujarat,[215] followed by playing a knock of 75* against the Kolkata Knight Riders.[216] In a rain-affected match against the Kings XI Punjab, Kohli achieved his fourth century of the season, surpassing the milestone of 4,000 runs in the league.[217] His batting drew high praise from Harsha Bhogle, who lauded his technical proficiency and shot-making.[218] Kohli\\'s consistent performances propelled Bangalore to the playoffs, as he scored four consecutive fifty-plus scores in must-win matches and finished the league stage with tally of 919 runs.[219] In the playoffs, Bangalore faced Gujarat in the first qualifier. Kohli was dismissed for a duck in that match, however his team emerged victorious, setting up a final against the Hyderabad.[220] Kohli contributed 54 runs in Bangalore\\'s pursuit of target of 209 in the final. Notwithstanding, Bangalore fell short by a margin of 8 runs, leaving him to acknowledge the Hyderabad team\\'s performance and express his gratitude to the Bangalore crowd for their support.[221] Kohli concluded the season with record 973 runs in 16 matches, at an average of 81.08, establishing himself as the highest run-scorer of the tournament and claiming Orange Cap with the title of Most Valuable Player.[222] Team\\'s coach, Vettori, praised Kohli for his contributions, stating:[223]\\n\\nVirat has been phenomenal. When you have got a guy at the top of the order who takes that much control and his performances are that great, it allows things to flow from there. Obviously a great captain does that — leads with his performance and he has been exceptional not only with his batting, but also fielding and leadership.\\nFluctuating form and captaincy struggles (2017–2019)\\nKohli celebrating his fifty against Mumbai Indians\\nIn the lead-up to the tenth season of the IPL, Kohli grappled with a shoulder injury, which sidelined him for the initial three fixtures of the tournament.[224] Upon his return in the fourth match against the Mumbai Indians, he scored 62 runs, albeit in a defeat for Bangalore.[225] Following this performance, Kohli delivered moderately in the subsequent two matches. However, in the face-off against the Kolkata Knight Riders, Kohli faced a setback after being dismissed for a duck as Bangalore stumbled to league\\'s lowest score of 49 runs. He promptly criticized the batting display as reckless.[226] In the encounter against the Rising Pune Supergiant, Kohli contributed 55 runs to his team\\'s total of 96 runs. Expressing disappointment, Kohli attributed the team\\'s struggles to a lack of intent and a fearful batting approach.[227] With Bangalore facing defeat in seven out of their ten matches, their hopes for playoffs were dashed, particularly after their loss to the Mumbai Indians, making them the first team to be eliminated from contention.[228] Wrapping up the tournament, Bangalore secured a victory in their last match against Delhi Daredevils, with Kohli scoring his fourth fifty of the season and amassing a total of 308 runs in 10 innings.[229] Kohli concluded that the season as a whole was the team\\'s most underwhelming performance to date.[230] Commemorating the ten-year anniversary of the league, ESPNcricinfo honoured Kohli by including him in the all-time IPL-XI.[231]\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He is a consummate surgeon at the crease, intensely focused, working hard, playing the ball into gaps in the field and staying calm under pressure. He is always judging the right time to consolidate and the right time to seize a game by the scruff of the neck.\"\\n\\n\\n\\xa0– Kohli\\'s RCB team mate AB de Villiers\\n\\nPrior to the commencement of the 2018 season, Bangalore retained Kohli for sum of ₹17 crore (US$2.0\\xa0million), making him the league\\'s most expensive player at the time.[232] His campaign began with 33 runs in a defeat against the Kolkata Knight Riders, where he expressed his discontentment with the number of dot balls he faced.[233] In contrast to his individual performances, which included twin fifties in the third and fourth matches, temporarily securing him the Orange Cap, Bangalore found themselves consistently on the losing side.[234] This predicament was primarily attributed to the team\\'s heavy reliance on Kohli and his partner de Villiers in the batting lineup, coupled with their challenges in the bowling department, which Kohli critiqued as being \"criminal\".[235] As the tournament progressed, Bangalore gradually discovered their winning rhythm, propelled by Kohli\\'s contributions, including scores of 70 and 48* in must-win encounters against Delhi Daredevils and Kings XI Punjab, respectively.[236] He eventually surpassed the milestone of 500 runs in the season, a feat he accomplished for a record fifth time.[237] However, in the decisive encounter against the Rajasthan Royals, Kohli faltered, managing 4 runs before succumbing to dismissal. This setback ultimately led to Bangalore\\'s elimination from the tournament. In the aftermath of their exit, Kohli publicly scrutinized the team\\'s middle-order batsmen for their failure to deliver substantial contributions during crucial matches, reflecting on the missed opportunities that defined their campaign.[238]\\nKohli\\'s start to the 2019 season proved underwhelming, as he managed 6 runs in the opener against the Chennai Super Kings.[239] Consequently, he opted to move down the batting order in an attempt to provide more depth. However, his struggle with form persisted, reflecting in Bangalore\\'s losses and prompting a quick reversal of the decision.[240] In an encounter against the Rajasthan Royals, Kohli marked his 100th appearance as Bangalore\\'s captain.[241] Albeit, that match ended in defeat, extending the team\\'s losing streak to four consecutive matches. Former cricketer Gautam Gambhir weighed in on Kohli\\'s lengthy tenure as captain, suggesting luck may have played a part despite his underwhelming performance as leader.[242] Kohli eventually found his rhythm in the fifth match, where he managed to score a half-century against the Kolkata Knight Riders.[243] However, Bangalore\\'s string of losses persisted, prompting him to acknowledge his team\\'s lackluster performance thus far.[244] After enduring record six consecutive defeats, Bangalore secured their first victory against the Kings XI Punjab, with Kohli contributing 67 runs in that match.[245] Subsequently, he scored his fifth century in the league;[246] however, his subsequent form saw a dip, as he struggled to make significant contributions with the bat in Bangalore\\'s successive victories. These wins, were not enough as Bangalore fell short in their bid to advance further in the tournament, marking their third consecutive elimination under Kohli\\'s captaincy.[247] Reflecting on the season, he expressed satisfaction with the team\\'s turnaround in the latter stages of the tournament, acknowledging the progress made despite their early challenges.[248]\\n\\nPerformance plunge and captaincy departure (2020–2022)\\nFollowing the resumption of cricket post the COVID-19 lockdown, Kohli returned to the field with cautious optimism.[249] However, positioned at number 3, his start to the 2020 season was lackluster, tallying a total of 18 runs across the first three matches. In the fourth match, Kohli found his rhythm, and scored 72 runs against the Rajasthan Royals.[250] His momentum continued as he played his standout innings of the season against the Chennai Super Kings, scoring an unbeaten 90.[251] Throughout the season, Kohli adhered to a strategy of accumulating runs primarily through singles and doubles, thereby minimizing the reliance on boundaries.[252] Under his captaincy, Bangalore secured victories in five of their opening eight matches, with Kohli himself contributing moderately, amassing a total of 389 runs by the conclusion of eleven matches.[253] However, during the latter part of the season, Kohli\\'s form dipped, coinciding with Bangalore\\'s consecutive losses in four matches following their promising start.[254] Despite these setbacks, Bangalore managed to qualify for the playoffs due to their net run rate.[255] Kohli concluded the league stage with a cumulative total of 460 runs, albeit with a slower strike rate of 122. Analysts at ESPNcricinfo attributed this performance in part to the distinctive conditions of the season, notably the relocation of matches to the UAE, where larger boundaries and an inexperienced middle order might have influenced Kohli\\'s risk-averse approach.[256] In the playoffs, Bangalore encountered the Sunrisers Hyderabad in the eliminator. Kohli, assuming the opening position alongside Devdutt Padikkal, encountered an early setback, scoring 7 runs before his dismissal. Bangalore succumbed in the knockout encounter, prompting Kohli to reflect on a palpable sense of nervousness among the players, which contributed to their defeat.[257]\\n\\nKohli captaining during a match in IPL 2021\\nAhead of the 2021 season opener, Kohli emphasized the strategic advantages of neutral venues for his team.[258] In their inaugural match against the Mumbai Indians, Kohli commenced with a score of 33, which he replicated in the subsequent fixture.[259] Notably, his first half-century of the season came against the Rajasthan Royals, where he scored an unbeaten 72, leading Bangalore to secure victory in four consecutive encounters.[260] Upon the resumption of the league in September, Kohli became the first player to make 200 appearances for a singular franchise.[261] Concurrently, Kohli announced his intention to relinquish the captaincy of Bangalore at the season\\'s end, this decision was met with speculation, with Sandip of The Indian Express suggesting that it could potentially afford Kohli to play with more freedom.[262] In subsequent fixtures, Kohli scored consecutive half-centuries against the Chennai Super Kings[263] and Mumbai, his innings against the latter also marked the completion of 10,000 runs in T20 cricket.[264] As the tournament progressed, Bangalore qualified for the playoffs, with two games to spare, attributed to performances by Glenn Maxwell and Harshal Patel in their respective domains.[265] However, Kohli experienced a dip in form leading up to the playoffs, as Bangalore prepared to face Kolkata Knight Riders in the eliminator. In the knockout clash, where he notched up 39 runs, Bangalore was unable to secure victory, thus concluding Kohli\\'s tenure as captain. In his post-match discourse, Kohli reaffirmed his commitment to delivering his utmost for Bangalore, while expressing gratitude for the loyalty and support extended by the franchise.[266]\\nPrior to the onset of the 2022 season, Bangalore chose to retain Kohli for a sum of ₹15 crore (US$1.8\\xa0million).[267] With Faf Du Plessis taking over the captaincy reins, Kohli commenced the season with a score of 41* against the Punjab Kings. However, positioned at number 3, Kohli\\'s subsequent innings were marked by inconsistency, with sole significant contribution of 48 runs against the Mumbai Indians. Struggling to regain his form, Kohli endured two consecutive ducks in matches against the Lucknow Super Giants and Sunrisers Hyderabad. By the seventh match of the season, Kohli found himself registering single-digit scores in four out of seven matches, accumulating a total of 119 runs at an average of 17.[268] Cricket analyst Jarrod Kimber, writing for ESPNcricinfo, remarked that Kohli\\'s batting seemed enigmatic and uncertain.[269] In an attempt to rectify his batting woes, Kohli was elevated to the opening position alongside du Plessis. It was in the tenth match that he managed to secure his maiden half-century of the season, albeit in 45 balls, marking it as his slowest in the T20 format.[270] However, his struggles persisted, as he encountered another duck against Hyderabad, accumulating a total of 216 runs in twelve matches.[271] Former Indian coach Ravi Shastri expressed his apprehension, suggesting that Kohli appeared \"overcooked\" and advocated for a break to rejuvenate himself. In concurrence with Shastri\\'s assessment, Kohli asserted that he did not feel the need to prove himself to anyone and believed in his ability to bounce back.[272] As the tournament progressed, Bangalore found themselves in a precarious position, requiring a victory in their final league match to remain in contention for the playoffs. Kohli rose to the occasion, scoring 73 runs against Gujarat Titans, and propelling Bangalore to victory.[273] However, Kohli faltered in the subsequent eliminator and qualifier 2, spelling the culmination of Bangalore\\'s campaign.\\n\\nMilestones galore (2023–2024)\\nIn the 2023 season, Kohli commenced his campaign with a score of 82* runs against the Mumbai Indians.[274] He maintained his form in subsequent matches, registering fifties in three out of the first four matches. Kohli\\'s batting approach during this period was marked by aggression in the powerplay overs, followed by a more cautious approach in the middle overs of the game. Reflecting on this tactical shift, Kohli noted that the middle overs are when teams typically introduce their premier bowlers, necessitating the assessment of the game\\'s evolving dynamics.[275] Moreover, in the absence of regular captain du Plessis, Kohli assumed the role of stand-in captain for several matches, while du Plessis contributed as an impact player.[276] Eight matches into the season, Kohli had scored fifties in five of them.[277] However, an altercation marred a match against the Lucknow Super Giants, where Kohli found himself in a confrontation with Gambhir, resulting in a fine for breaching the code of conduct.[278] Throughout the season, Kohli relied on his placement and running between the wickets to maintain a scoring rate above a run a ball.[279] As the season progressed, Bangalore needed victories in their final two games to clinch a spot in the playoffs. Kohli stepped up in a pivotal match against the Sunrisers Hyderabad, scoring a century, to secure a win for his team.[280] In the subsequent fixture, he scored another century, surpassing Gayle for the most centuries in the league. However, Bangalore fell short in defending their total, leading to their elimination from the tournament. Kohli concluded the season with a tally of 639 runs at an average of 53.2 and a strike rate of 140.[281]\\nIn the 2024 season, Kohli began slow, scoring only 21 runs against the Chennai Super Kings, in a loss too.[282] The next match however, he scored 77 runs against the Punjab Kings, a crucial knock, and he won Man of the Match. Kohli continued this type of form throughout the tournament, scoring 2 fifties in the first 4 games. In a game against the Rajasthan Royals, Kohli scored 113*, which is his highest score in the IPL.  However, he did it in 72 balls, which was 12 out of 20 overs. Bengaluru lost this match, and was on a 6 game losing streak,[283] before Kohli scored another fifty that helped them win against Sunrisers Hyderabad. Kohli scored two more fifties in the next 3 matches, including an impressive 92 off just 47 and the runout of Shashank Singh.[284] RCB won the next 2 games to qualify for the playoffs, and after being on a 6 game losing streak, turned around a came back with a 6 game winning streak.\\nOn 12 May 2024, Kohli added another feather to his hat as he took the field against Delhi Capitals (DC) at M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. He became the first player in the history of the Indian Premier League to play 250 matches for a single franchise.[285]\\nIn the eliminator game against the Rajasthan Royals, Kohli surpassed the 8000 run mark. He was now 1000 runs apart from the second highest score in the IPL, Shikhar Dhawan. Kohli won his second Orange Cap award, with 741 runs scored and an average of 61.75.[286][287]\\n\\nPlayer profile\\nComparisons to Sachin Tendulkar\\nKohli\\'s batting style and approach to the game have frequently drawn comparisons to Sachin Tendulkar, whom he regards as the epitome of excellence in the sport of cricket. Called Tendulkar\\'s successor,[288][289] he is widely considered to have the potential to surpass his records.[290][291] Kohli has stated he tried to mirror Tendulkar\\'s style of batting, imitating his shots and attempting to hit sixes in a similar manner.[292]\\nHis aggressive and dynamic style has earned him accolades from cricketing greats such as Vivian Richards, who has acknowledged Kohli\\'s similarities to his own style.[293] He has been lauded as the \"new king of world cricket\" by Dean Jones, a former Australian cricketer.[294] Kohli\\'s skills with the bat have earned him accolades from former West Indies great Brian Lara, who has ranked him among the best batsmen in the world.[295]\\nTendulkar proclaimed that Kohli possesses the potential to surpass his record of 100 international centuries. He acknowledged Kohli\\'s batting aptitude and steadfastness of accumulating runs.[296] In 2013, Tendulkar retired from international cricket, marking the end of an era for Indian cricket. Kohli played alongside Tendulkar in the team.[297]\\nIn 2024, Kohli became the fastest player to score 27,000 runs in international cricket. He surpassed Tendulkar\\'s record, achieving the feat in 594 innings compared to Tendulkar\\'s 623, during the Test against Bangladesh at Green Park Stadium. Kohli now joins Ricky Ponting and Kumar Sangakkara as the only players to have crossed this milestone in international cricket.[298]\\n\\nPlaying style\\nKohli possesses technical abilities and a dynamic playing demeanour.[299][300] His customarily batting position in ODl cricket is at number three with a slightly open-chested stance and a grip on the bottom handle of his bat.[301] He has been noted for his agile footwork, expansive range of strokes, and his propensity for adeptly orchestrating innings whilst thriving in high-pressure situations.[302][303] In his batting technique, Kohli tends to favour playing grounded shots rather than attempting big hits. He is appreciated for his ability to execute wrist shots and his consistent prowess in the mid-wicket and cover region.[304][305]\\n\\nKohli playing his famous flick shot at the 2015 Cricket World Cup\\nKohli has often expressed his admiration for the cover drive, which he considers to be his signature stroke. He uses the flick shot, particularly when facing deliveries aimed towards leg stump.[16] Having a limited recourse to the sweep shot, Kohli\\'s batting technique is characterized by an emphasis on ground shots that primarily yield runs in the regions between deep square leg and mid-on.[306] Kohli scores runs between long-off and long-on with an aligned bat. His combo of bat-speed and wrist movements enable him to craft innovative angles that disrupt traditional field positioning.[307] Kohli is also an extremely proficient fielder.[308]\\nHe has a vulnerability to deliveries that are wide of the off-stump.[309] Bowlers often exploit this weakness by targeting him with such deliveries, especially in Test and ODl matches.[310][311][312] Cricket experts such as VVS Laxman and former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar have acknowledged this weakness,[313][314] and former New Zealand cricketer Richard Hadlee has also noted that Kohli is particularly susceptible to out-swinging deliveries.[315]\\nKohli has recognition as a limited-overs batsman.[316][317] In ODIs, he boasts an average of 65.5 runs when batting second and 51.7 runs when batting first.[318] He has amassed 28 of his 51 ODI hundreds in run-chases,[319] and holds the record for the most hundreds scored batting second.[320] Kohli has often expressed a fondness for the challenge of chasing a score, relishing the opportunity to test himself and demonstrate his ability to manage strike rotation and execute boundary hits.[321] His colleagues admire his self-assurance, dedication, concentration, and work ethic, which are the driving forces behind his success.[322][323]\\n\\nAggression\\nKohli\\'s playing style is aggressive, a trait that extends to his leadership on field.[324][325] His captaincy is characterized as proactive, taking decisions and leading the team by example.[326] Kohli has been the subject of much media scrutiny and criticism in the early stages of his career. He was often portrayed as a brash and arrogant individual, eliciting mixed reactions.[327][328] While some have praised his assertiveness and confidence,[329][330] others have criticized Kohli\\'s behaviour for crossing the boundaries of fair play and for losing control, sometimes resulting in a loss of composure.[331] The cricketer has persistently maintained that his aggression acts as a source of inspiration and drives his focus and motivation on the field.[332] Writing for The New York Times, Huw Richards noted Kohli\\'s self-assuredness and \"assertiveness\" in contrast to some former Indian cricketers who he felt had exhibited an inclination towards excessive politeness and reticence, and that Kohli embodies his combative demeanour both on and off the cricket field.[333]\\n\\nPersonal life\\nMarriage and kids\\nKohli with wife Anushka Sharma at their Mumbai reception\\nKohli and actress Anushka Sharma met on the sets of an advertisement they were both signed to star in. They started dating in 2013 and their popularity led to the masses giving them the moniker Virushka.[334] During an interview with Graham Bensinger, he recalled how they met during the promotional shoot for Clear shampoo.[335] Their union attracted significant media and public interest.[336] On 11 December 2017, the couple got married in a ceremony held in Florence, Italy.[337]\\nOn 11 January 2021, they had their first child, a daughter.[338][339] On 15 February 2024, the couple welcomed their second child, a son.[340]\\n\\nEating habits\\nIn 2018, Kohli disclosed that he had made the decision to adopt a vegetarian diet in an effort to alleviate the symptoms of a cervical spine issue caused by elevated levels of uric acid. This condition was impacting his finger movements, thus, affecting his performance as a batsman. He made a conscious effort to abstain from consuming meat, as part of his regimen for maintaining optimal health.[341] He has since clarified that his dietary choices do not align with a vegan lifestyle and he continues to consume dairy products and eggs effectively making what is known in India as an eggetarian.[342][343][344] His hard work and discipline have earned him the reputation of being one of the fittest cricketers in the world.[345]\\n\\nTattoos & more\\nKohli has acknowledged a belief in superstitions and owns various lucky charms and rituals that he feels serve to bring him good fortune on the cricket field. One such tradition involves the donning of black wristband. Additionally, he prefers a particular pair of gloves, which he has consistently worn.[14] Furthermore, Kohli has been observed sporting a kara, a traditional bangle often worn for religious or spiritual purposes, on his right arm since 2012.[346] In addition to the previously mentioned superstitions, Kohli has also established the ritual of consistently donning white shoes on the cricket field.[347] Kohli has tattoos of the Hindu deity Lord Shiva, the sacred syllable \"Om\", the names of his parents, Prem and Saroj, a tribal emblem, a representation of a serene monastery, a samurai warrior, the astrological symbol of the scorpion, and his ODl and Test match cap numbers.[348][349]\\n\\nOff the field\\nImage & endorsements\\nVirat Kohli with Audi Q7\\nIn 2008, Kohli was approached by sports agent Bunty Sajdeh of Cornerstone Sport and Entertainment after his performance in the ICC Under-19 World Cup. Sajdeh was impressed with Kohli\\'s leadership skills and attitude and saw potential in the young cricketer. After being recommended by Yuvraj Singh, Kohli was signed to Cornerstone Sport and Entertainment.[350] Over the years, Kohli\\'s brand endorsement portfolio has experienced significant growth. In 2013, it was reported that his endorsements were valued at over ₹1 billion (US$12\\xa0million).[351] In 2023, his brand value reached ₹1,000 crore (US$120\\xa0million).[352] His bat deal with MRF is one of the most financially rewarding deals in cricket history.[353] In 2017, Kohli entered into an endorsement agreement with Puma that spanned over eight years and was estimated to be worth around ₹1.1 billion (US$13\\xa0million).

World Cup on two separate occasions, in 2014 and 2016.[432] In terms of ODI centuries, he ranks first with 51.[433] He surpassed Sachin Tendulkar\\'s tally of 49 ODI tons and achieved this feat on 15 November 2023 in the semifinal of the 2023 ODI World Cup, while also becoming the first player to score more than 700 runs in a single edition of the tournament.[434] Furthermore, in international cricket, Kohli has amassed 82 centuries, second only to Sachin Tendulkar\\'s 100 centuries.[435] In 2018, Kohli set a record, becoming the first player to score 1,000 ODI runs in 11 innings in a calendar year.[436] In 2022, he achieved another milestone by scoring 1,000 runs in the T20 World Cup, becoming the second player to reach this feat after Mahela Jayawardene.[437] During the match against Bangladesh, he became the top-scorer in the history of T20 World Cup.[438]\\n\\nInternational centuries\\nMain article: List of international cricket centuries by Virat Kohli\\n\\nCenturies

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to\\nbe superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly\\nless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-\\nto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\\nensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,\\nour model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after\\ntraining for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the\\nbest models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to\\nother tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with\\nlarge and limited training data.\\n∗Equal contribution.

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2\\nBackground\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3\\nModel Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2\\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1\\nEncoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder:\\nThe encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder:\\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2\\nAttention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\\nattention layers running in parallel.\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\\nquery with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V\\n(1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof\\n1\\n√dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by\\n1\\n√dk .\\n3.2.2\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = Pdk\\ni=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\\n4\\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\nMultiHead(Q, K, V ) = Concat(head1, ..., headh)W O\\nwhere headi = Attention(QW Q\\ni , KW K\\ni , V W V\\ni )\\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices W Q\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dk, W K\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dk, W V\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dv\\nand W O ∈Rhdv×dmodel.\\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3\\nApplications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3\\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4\\nEmbeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5\\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\\nfor different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel\\nsize of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\nLayer Type\\nComplexity per Layer\\nSequential\\nMaximum Path Length\\nOperations\\nSelf-Attention\\nO(n2 · d)\\nO(1)\\nO(1)\\nRecurrent\\nO(n · d2)\\nO(n)\\nO(n)\\nConvolutional\\nO(k · n · d2)\\nO(1)\\nO(logk(n))\\nSelf-Attention (restricted)\\nO(r · n · d)\\nO(1)\\nO(n/r)\\n3.5\\nPositional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nPE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4\\nWhy Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5\\nTraining\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1\\nTraining Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2\\nHardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3\\nOptimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)\\n(3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4\\nRegularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7\\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the\\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\\nModel\\nBLEU\\nTraining Cost (FLOPs)\\nEN-DE\\nEN-FR\\nEN-DE\\nEN-FR\\nByteNet [18]\\n23.75\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk [39]\\n39.2\\n1.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL [38]\\n24.6\\n39.92\\n2.3 · 1019\\n1.4 · 1020\\nConvS2S [9]\\n25.16\\n40.46\\n9.6 · 1018\\n1.5 · 1020\\nMoE [32]\\n26.03\\n40.56\\n2.0 · 1019\\n1.2 · 1020\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39]\\n40.4\\n8.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL Ensemble [38]\\n26.30\\n41.16\\n1.8 · 1020\\n1.1 · 1021\\nConvS2S Ensemble [9]\\n26.36\\n41.29\\n7.7 · 1019\\n1.2 · 1021\\nTransformer (base model)\\n27.3\\n38.1\\n3.3 · 1018\\nTransformer (big)\\n28.4\\n41.8\\n2.3 · 1019\\nResidual Dropout\\nWe apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop = 0.1.\\nLabel Smoothing\\nDuring training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵls = 0.1 [36]. This\\nhurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\\n6\\nResults\\n6.1\\nMachine Translation\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)\\nin Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0\\nBLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2\\nModel Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8\\nTable 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture.

This\\nsuggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility\\nfunction than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,\\nbigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our\\nsinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical\\nresults to the base model.\\n6.3\\nEnglish Constituency Parsing\\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English\\nconstituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.
